# Complex Number Class üî¢

This class includes many trig functions and is **immutable**. None of its
methods will change the real or imaginary components, instead, they return
new complex objects.

To retrieve the real and imaginary parts of the complex number `z`, use
`z.real` and `z.imag`.

## Method Chaining üîó

Most methods can be chained. For example, `z.tan().sqrt()` will calculate
and return the square root of the tangent of `z`. In mathematics, we are
evaluating `sqrt(tan(z))` leaving `z` unchanged.

## Floating Point Errors üîç

In some situations, floating point errors can be significant. Testing for
equality or to see if the number represents a real value can be problematic.
By default, the maximum permitted difference is `10^-8`; but in some
situations, this may be too restrictive and reject values you wish to
consider equal. Use accessor `Complex.epsilon` to change the static
`#epsilon` property's default value.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice that b/c `Complex.epsilon` is a static accessor, changing it affects
all instances of class `Complex`. As a workaround, all methods which rely on it
accept an optional `epsilon` argument to be used in the test, thus ignoring the
global static default value.

# Complex
## Summary
The code defines a class called `Complex` that represents complex numbers.
It provides various mathematical operations and utility methods
for working with complex numbers.

## Example Usage
```javascript
// Create a complex number
const z = new Complex(2, 3);

// Perform mathematical operations
const sum = z.add(new Complex(1, 1));
const product = z.mult(2);
const abs = z.abs();

// Print the complex number
console.log(z.toString());
```
